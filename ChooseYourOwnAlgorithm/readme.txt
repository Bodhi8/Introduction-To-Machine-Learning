IntroMachineLearningChooseYourOwnAlgorithm

A critical skill for any data analyst is the ability to figure out new things about machine learning,
which is the goal for this lesson.
The whole lesson is a mini-project. 
The goal is to do ** terrain classification ** with an algorithm of your choice,
researching and deploying it on your own. 

Your algorithm choices are the following:

Supervised Classification Algorithms 
1.) k nearest neighbors - classic, simple, easy to understand
2.) random forest - 'ensemble methods'
3.)adaboost (sometimes also called boosted decision tree)  - 'ensemble methods'

ensemble methods - meta classifiers built from many, usually decision trees, many classifiers working together to come up with a single decision 

tasks list
- make predictions
- evaluate the selected algorithm - 'accuracy'

We can’t check your results, because there are too many combinations of algorithms and parameters to check everything that you could try, 
but you have seen the accuracy that our previous algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree) 
achieved and can self-assess whether the new algorithm does better.
In the *** choose_your_own/your_algorithm.py *** file, 
you’ll find some starter code to get the data all set up for you. 
The following videos also give a little more background on the algorithms and process you should follow, but you’re mostly finding your own way here. 
Good luck!
